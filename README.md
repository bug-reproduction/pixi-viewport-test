# Issue when resizing downward

Get started: 

```
git clone https://github.com/bug-reproduction/pixi-viewport-test.git
cd pixi-viewport-test
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

Then you can open a browser to navigate on the demo

Make sure you start with a smaller window than your screen, reload if needed

Then expand the window and try to drag aounr, you ll see that in some places, dragiing becomes impossible
